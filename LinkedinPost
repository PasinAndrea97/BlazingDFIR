Did someone said Incident Response?

One of the BIGGEST ISSUES with IR operations is the first phase, there the IR team needs to: 

- Understand the attacked surface

- Comprehend Incident severity

- Efficently assess all involved devices



BlazingDFIR is an astonishingly powerful Remote DFIR tool made by the NF_Security team that does all of this in an automated manner.

You don't need to know much about customer infrastructure, with BlazingDFIR you can figure it out by yourself!



From now on your IR team will be able to respond within minutes from the first customer call
